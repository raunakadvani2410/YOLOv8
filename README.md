This project aims to employ computer vision techniques to classify images that contain birds. To be more precise, this model will count the number of birds present in various images taken in the Amazon Rainforest, specifically focusing on the challenging task of being able to identify birds in the rainforest environment where they are often camouflaged or hidden. By leveraging advanced image processing and CNNs, we will automate bird identification, which can have various applications in ecological studies, conservation efforts, and wildlife monitoring.
